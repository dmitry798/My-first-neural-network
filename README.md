# My-first-neural-network

I wanted to combine my knowledge of C++ here and understand in detail how backpropagation works.

The code can be improved, at least by using python and the scikit-learn library. If you stay in C++, then use vectors. Despite all the disadvantages, the perceptron is working at the specified parameters of the speed and number of times the model is trained. The model predicts with what probability the next element will be 1 or 0. The model can be trained to recognize text using MNIST, while transferring the model to QT Creator.
